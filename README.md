This is my attempt at simulating Conway's Game of Life. The game will run until 50 generations have passed or until the board is empty, whichever happens first.

To run the game:

    $ ruby life.rb number_of_rows number_of_cols

If no arguments are given for number_of_rows or number_of_cols, the board will default to a random number between 1 and 50.

Enjoy!
